# Minimum Spanning Tree


minimun spanning tree is an algorithm which spans across every node in the graph

the cost of spanning tree is the sum of the weights of all edges in tree or graph

## algorithm


```

minimun spanning tree is an algorithm which spans across every node in the graph

the cost of spanning tree is the sum of the weights of all edges in tree or graph

store the nodes in the objects
	a) source
	b) destination
	c) cost
	d) visited as boolean

visited nodes as map 
    key node and cost
	
step 1: find  the minimun cost of nodes and put in the visited nodes map

step 2: while visited nodes list has not fully visited nodes all nodes
	
		step 2.1: find the minimun cost from the non visited nodes 
		
		step 2.2: check if the eigher of the node in nodes are visited 
		 
		step 2.3: if so add it in the visited nodes map

step 3: find the cost from the visited nodes map
