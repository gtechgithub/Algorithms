## Algorithm

1. input node and its neighbour into the array linked list

2. add the starting node in the stack

3. while the stack is not empty 

	3.1 pop from the stack and add into the visited queue
	3.2 look out for neighbour if not vised the add it in the stack

### Array Linked list of how it is added

### Explanation:

here in DFS, lets assume the starting node is 2, then it's edges are 0 , followed by 2
it is added in stack order as 0, 2, again it will lookup for edges of 2, and so on..
so the visited nodes will be 2, 3, 0, 1
