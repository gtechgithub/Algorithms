# Breadth First Search or BFS for a Graph


1. it uses Queue mechanism
2. it find out the shortest path and non repeating path



**Psuedo code** 


```

Step 1: add the start node into the queue

Step 2: while queue is available continue the loop

		Step 2.1: add the element of the queue in the visited queue and remove from queue
		
		Step 2.1: get the neighbour nodes for the queue element
		
		Step 3.1 while neigbours node is avaiable loop
		
			     Step 3.2 add the neighbour node into the queue if it is not visited and not available in the queue
		

Step 3: print the visited nodes
